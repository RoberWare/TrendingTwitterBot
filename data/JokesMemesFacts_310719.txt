Dear sleep, 

I'm sorry we broke up this morning. 

I want you back.
Hardest thing to answer: 

Describe yourself.
A relationship with no trust is like having a phone with no service, you just play games.
Offering someone food, and secretly hoping, they don't want it.
Keep the dream alive! 

Hit the snooze button!

Sometimes the phone battery lasts longer than the relationship.
I don't really want to be a super hero. I just want super powers.
That one friend who listens the same songs over and over again.
Some people don't get sarcasm. They really don't.
Dear food, 

Either stop being so delicious or stop making me fat.
Dear radio stations,

You do realize there's more than just 10 songs in the world, right?
Be yourself! 

Everyone else is already taken.
